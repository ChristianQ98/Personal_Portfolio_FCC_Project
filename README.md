# Personal_Portfolio_FCC_Project
This is the fifth, and final, project from the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification course. It is a personal portfolio, which highlights the four previous projects. The template for the project was taken from https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG. In this project, I learned and got a better understanding of many different tools and concepts, such as animations, transitions, navigation bars, and structuring a web page so that it flows smoothly, while also remaining responsive. In the future, I hope to implement more animations, smooth transitions, and creative designs.
